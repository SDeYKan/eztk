This is my first library!
A small library to simplify even further the syntax of tkinter.
The aim of this library is to be able to make useful, even though maybe not the prettiest, GUI's with the minimal lines possible.
Currently doesn't support every single native widget, but it has a lot.
Not mature or documented enough and there's still a lot to change and add to it, but right now it's pretty usable.
Hope you find it useful!
